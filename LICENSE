This is the optimized implementation of the combination of the two methods described described in the following paper:
	1.Wang H, Wang C, Chen C L, et al. F-loam: Fast lidar odometry and mapping
	  2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 
	2.Kim G, Kim A. Scan context: Egocentric spatial descriptor for place recognition within 3d point cloud map
           2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)

And this work is modified based on Advanced implementation of F-LOAM and SC-A-LOAM by
